Dude, just finished Squad 36 and, omg, what was that? Seriously, it's like they were trying to do some superhero thing but ended up with, I don’t even know, like a bunch of cats in a blender. The pacing was all over the place. One minute they're fighting bad guys, the next they're having deep emo talks like some soap opera from the '90s. 

> You know when you're just trying to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   and suddenly you're questioning your choices in life? Yeah, that's what 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 this felt like. And speaking of, I should just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   next time, so I can scrub through the boring bits. Not that there were many interesting parts, but you get my point, right?

The villain, though. What was his deal? Looked like he walked out of a discount costume store. I mean, how are we supposed to take him seriously with those rubber gloves? 😂 And the dialogue, ha, don't even get me started. It’s like the writers were just hitting the keyboard hoping something smart would magically appear. Spoiler: it didn't.

I'm all for some mindless fun, but this... Anyway, you know that feeling when a   tries too hard to be cool and just falls flat? That's Squad 36 in a nutshell. And the CGI was like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 someone’s bad dream from 2005. They really spent the budget on craft services, huh? Maybe I'll need to re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it with some friends for the laughs or, like, instead of counting sheep next time I can't sleep.

const badMovie = Squad 36; // Oh god, why am I even typing this??

At least we got to hang out and chat. I guess that's a win. What's next on our list? Hope it's better than this mess. Hit me up when you're 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦, we need a redemption   night. 🍕🥤
